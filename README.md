### 1. Installation
 There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python 3.

### 2. Project Motivation
 For this project, I was interestested to answer some business questions.
- What is the highest, lowest, and mean of customers' income?
- What is the age group distribution?
- Examine the effectiveness of the offer type of complete offer vs reviewed offer?



### 3. File Descriptions
 There are notebooks available, and Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

 Here's the file structure of the project:

```
- Data
| - portfolio.json
| - profile.json
| - transcript.json

- Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb

- README.md
```




### 4. Summary
 The basic task is to use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present each type of offer.

### 5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

 Must give credit to Starbuck for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
